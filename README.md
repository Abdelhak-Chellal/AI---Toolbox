# AI Toolbox - Search Algorithms, Min-Max Game, and CSP Solver

## Introduction
Welcome to the AI Toolbox, a project that combines various AI algorithms to provide visualization and functionality for search algorithms, a game (`CONNECT4`) using min-max algorithms, and a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) solver. This toolbox aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these AI techniques through interactive visualizations and practical examples.

## Features

### 1.Search Algorithm Visualization
The toolbox offers a visualization module that allows you to explore and understand various search algorithms. It includes the following algorithms:

Depth-First Search (DFS)
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)
A* Search
Depth-Limited Search
Iterative Deepening Search
Hill-Climbing Search
Min-Max Search

### 2. Min-Max Game
The AI Toolbox also includes a game module that utilizes the min-max algorithm. This module allows you to play a game against an AI opponent. The game is called  Connect Four. The AI opponent utilizes the min-max algorithm to make intelligent decisions, providing a challenging and interactive experience.

### 3. CSP solver
The CSP solver module within the toolbox enables you to solve complex constraint satisfaction problems. It employs the CSP algorithm to find solutions for problems involving variables, domains, and constraints. You can input your own problem instances or use predefined examples to explore and analyze the CSP solving process.
